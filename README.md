# Admission Prediction Using AI

## Overview

This project aims to predict admission chances for prospective students using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a student being admitted to a university based on various features such as academic performance, test scores, and extracurricular activities.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Aggregates data from various sources, including student profiles and academic records.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Prediction**: Provides admission predictions based on new input data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
